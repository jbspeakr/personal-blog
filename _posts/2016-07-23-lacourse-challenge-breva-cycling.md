Today, I received my first Strava Badge by completing the _La Course Edition_ of their [Recon Ride](https://www.strava.com/challenges/ReconRide) challenges...

> “Celebrate La Course by Le Tour de France with a Recon Ride on your home turf. [...] On Sunday, July 24th, the fastest women on the planet will sprint for glory along the Champs-Élysées after 89 blistering kilometers of racing. And while you can't ride alongside Lizzie Armitstead and the Boels-Dolmans Cycling Team, you can ride your own La-Course-inspired route with your friends.”

Following that calling, I put on my Breva Jersey and Sormano Bibshorts and hit the road down south towards Berlin's [_Crown of the East_](https://www.jbspeakr.cc/ostkrone-berlin-cycling-route/) ("Ostkrone"). Unfortunately, after 76km my back tyre hit something unusual sharp and I had finish the challenge several hours later, circling Tempelhof Airport.

Long story short, if you want to know more about [Breva Cycling Wear](http://www.brevacycling.it/en/), check out the nice [review by Espertron](http://espertron.cc/2016/06/breva-jersey/) - I'll definitely add my own 50 cent after having their stuff in use for a couple of weeks, so stay tuned!
