It's Velothon-time in Berlin! For the 10th time in a row, the sportive cycling race will take place in my home-town Berlin.
This year not just offering the classic 60 and 120km routes but also an all-new 180km course that incorporates both old-school tracks...

> “The courses are 60, 120 or 180km long and are among the fastest cycling courses you're going to find on this planet...

To allow you to keep an eye on the upcoming course while also focussing hard on
lining yourself up with the cyclist in front, I just clicked together the three EuroEyes
