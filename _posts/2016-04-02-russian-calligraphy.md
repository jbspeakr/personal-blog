_Всем не угодишь_ is an old Russian proverb that basically translates into _You can not please everyone_. I created this work with a Pilot Parallel Pen (6.0mm) and black ink on Modulor Z140 wood-free paper. I chose an old slavic letter style to underline its origins.

Ah, and I also did a white-on-black version of it, using white Rohrer & Klingner Zeichentusche ink on black paper:
