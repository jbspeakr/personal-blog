Hi. My name is Jan Brennenstuhl, I live and work in Berlin Germany, where I was born and raised. I am a software engineer, web security enthusiast & clean code artist with a huge interest in interdisciplinary software development and engineering leadership. I am a big fan of bonsai cultivation techniques, coffee & road cycling.

I currently work for **Zalando SE** in Berlin as a member of the information security unit where me and my team work on a central SSO solution for our customers. We are currently disrupting the companies customer identity and access management solutions.

I've worked as an engineer and lead on eCommerce funnels, rule engines, cloud strategies, IAM and SSO solutions, web services, integrations, technology research, legacy migrations, decomissioning projects, modularising monolithic systems - various things, mostly in eCommerce and Security though. As a supporter of the **Open Knowledge Foundation** in Germany, I furthermore used to help growing the German open data community through hands-on hackdays and the development of civic apps. 

I am an Internet standards enthusiast, who values open source and open formats over custom builds. For me, quality software products are created best by small teams of product-minded engineers with a narrow, well-defined business scope and a clear vision. I'm especially passionate about leading engineers as well as creating and operating reliable, secure and maintainable software products.

I hold a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the **University of Potsdam**, where I completed my thesis on *"Certificate Management in the Cloud for Authentication in university Environment"*. Iâ€™ve also studied Media Informatics at the **Beuth University** of Applied Sciences in Berlin.
