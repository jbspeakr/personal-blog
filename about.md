Hi. My name is Jan Brennenstuhl, I live and work in Berlin Germany, where I was born and raised. I am a full-stack web developer, computer security enthusiast & clean code artist with a huge interest in interdisciplinary, agile software development and the open web. I am a big fan of urban art, coffee & cycling.

I currently work for **Zalando SE** in Berlin as a member of the tech infrastructure platform where we create "tools for the builders". We are currently rethinking the companies core identity and access management solution.

I used to work for **Immobilienscout24**.de, a German real estate platform, where I was part of an agile web development team, mainly focused on modularising and optimising the platforms legacy web app. I also contributed to the companies AWS cloud migration strategy team and took an active role in my teams hiring process.

As a supporter of the **Open Knowledge Foundation** in Germany, I furthermore used to help growing the German open data community through hands-on hackdays and the development of civic apps. I am also member of the Chaos Computer Club and the German Pirates Party.

During my studies I was working part-time in the Research and Development dept. at **Zertificon Solutions** a Berlin-based IT security company focused on identity and access management.

I hold a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the **University of Potsdam**, where I completed my thesis on *"Certificate Management in the Cloud for Authentication in university Environment"*. Iâ€™ve also studied Media Informatics at the **Beuth University** of Applied Sciences in Berlin.
