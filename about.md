Hi. My name is Jan Brennenstuhl, I live and work in Berlin Germany, where I was born and raised. I am a product-minded software engineer, web security enthusiast & clean code artist with a huge interest in interdisciplinary software development and engineering leadership. I am a big fan of bonsai cultivation techniques, coffee, hiking & road cycling.

I currently work for **Zalando SE** in Berlin as a member of the information security unit where me and my team of engineers work on a central SSO solution for our customers. We are currently disrupting the companies customer identity and access management solutions.

I've worked as a software engineer and lead on eCommerce funnels, rule engines, cloud strategies, IAM and SSO solutions, REST APIs, system integrations, technology research, legacy migrations, decomissioning projects and modularising monolithic systems - various things, mostly in eCommerce and security though. I practised software archaeology more than I set up greenfield web services.   

I am an Internet standards enthusiast, who values open source and open formats over custom builds. For me, quality software products are created best by small teams of product-minded engineers with a narrow, well-defined business scope and a clear vision. I'm especially passionate about leading engineers as well as creating and operating reliable, secure and maintainable software products.

I hold a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the **University of Potsdam**, where I completed my thesis on *"Certificate Management in the Cloud for Authentication in university Environment"*. Iâ€™ve also studied Media Informatics at the **Beuth University** of Applied Sciences in Berlin.
